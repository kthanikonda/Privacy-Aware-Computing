Most people who use X want something short and easy to understand. While we wish we could fit everything you need to know into a post, our regulators ask us to meet our legal obligations by describing them all in a lot of detail.\\nWith that in mind, we\\u2019ve written our Privacy Policy as simply as possible to empower you to make informed decisions when you use X by making sure you understand and have control over the information we collect, how it\\u2019s used, and when it\\u2019s shared. \\nSo if you skip reading every word of the Privacy Policy, at least know this:\\n  X is a public platform\\nLearn what\\u2019s viewable & searchable\\nWe collect some data\\nabout you\\nLearn what we collect & how\\nAffiliate services may have their own policies\\nLearn about affiliates\\nWe use your data to make X better\\nLearn how we make your info work\\nYou can control your experience\\nLearn how to update your settings\\nIf you have questions about how we use data, just ask\\nLearn how to contact us\\nPrivacy Policy\\n1. Information We Collect 2. How We Use Information 3. Sharing Information 4. How Long We Keep Information 5. Take Control 6. Your Rights and Ours 7. X's Audience 8. Changes To This Privacy Policy 9. General 10. How To Contact X\\n  1. Information We Collect\\nThe information we collect when you use X falls into three categories.\\n1.1 Information you provide us.\\nTo use some of our products and services you need to have an account, and to create an account, you need to provide us certain information. Likewise, if you use our paid products and services, we cannot provide them to you without getting payment information. Basically, certain information is necessary if you want to use many of our products and services.\\nPersonal Accounts. If you create an account, you must provide us with some information so that we can provide our services to you. This includes a display name (for example, \\u201cCreators\\u201d); a username (for example, @XCreators); a password; an email address or phone number; a date of birth; your display language; and third-party single sign-in information (if you choose this sign-in method). You can also choose to share your location in your profile and posts, and to upload your address book to X to help find people you may know. Your profile information, which includes your display name and username, is always public, but you can use either your real name or a pseudonym. And remember, you can create multiple X accounts, for example, to express different parts of your identity, professional or otherwise. \\nProfessional Accounts. If you create a professional account, you also need to provide us with a professional category, and may provide us with other information, including street address, contact email address, and contact phone number, all of which will always be public. \\nPayment Information. In order to purchase ads or other offerings provided as part of our paid products and services you will need to provide us payment information, including your credit or debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address.\\nPreferences. When you set your preferences using your settings, we collect that information so that we can respect your preferences.\\nBiometric Information. Based on your consent, we may collect and use your biometric information for safety, security, and identification purposes.\\nJob Applications / Recommendations. We may collect and use your personal information (such as your biographical information, employment history, educational history, employment preferences, skills and abilities, and job search activity and engagement, in addition to the information we already collect as disclosed in the \\u201cInformation we collect when you use X\\u201d section of our Privacy Policy below) to recommend potential jobs to you, to share with potential employers when you apply for a job, to enable connections for professional opportunities, and to show you more relevant advertising.\\n1.2 Information we collect when you use X.\\nWhen you use our services, we collect information about how you use our products and services. We use that information to provide you with products and services, to help keep X more secure and respectful for everyone, and more relevant to you.\\nUsage Information. We collect information about your activity on X, including:\\nPosts and other content you post (including the date, application, and version of X) and information about your broadcast activity (e.g., Spaces), including broadcasts you\\u2019ve created and when you created them, your lists, bookmarks, and Communities you are a part of.\\nYour interactions with other users\\u2019 content, such as reposts, likes, bookmarks, shares, downloads, replies, if other users mention or tag you in content or if you mention or tag them, and broadcasts you\\u2019ve participated in (including your viewing history, listening, commenting, speaking, and reacting).\\nHow you interact with others on the platform, such as people you follow and people who follow you, metadata related to Encrypted Messages, and when you use Direct Messages, including the contents of the messages, the recipients, and date and time of messages.\\nIf you communicate with us, such as through email, we will collect information about the communication and its content.\\nWe collect information on links you interact with across our services (including in our emails sent to you).\\nPurchase and payments. To allow you to make a payment or send money using X features or services, including through an intermediary, we may receive information about your transaction such as when it was made, when a subscription is set to expire or auto-renew, and amounts paid or received.\\nDevice Information. We collect information from and about the devices you use to access X, including:\\nInformation about your connection, such as your IP address, browser type, and related information.\\nInformation about your device and its settings, such as device and advertising ID, operating system, carrier, language, memory, apps installed, and battery level.\\nYour device address book, if you\\u2019ve chosen to share it with us.\\nLocation Information. When you use X, we collect some information about your approximate location to provide the service you expect, including showing you relevant ads. You can also choose to share your current precise location or places where you\\u2019ve previously used X by enabling these settings in your account.\\nInferred Identity. We may collect or receive information that we use to infer your identity as detailed below:\\nWhen you sign into X on a browser or device, we will associate that browser or device with your account. Subject to your settings, we may also associate your account with browsers or devices other than those you use to sign into X (or associate your signed-out device or browser with other browsers or devices or X-generated identi\\ufb01ers).\\nWhen you provide other information to X, including an email address or phone number, we associate that information with your X account. Subject to your settings, we may also use this information in order to infer other information about your identity, for example by associating your account with hashes of email addresses that share common components with the email address you have provided to X.\\nWhen you access X and are not signed in, we may infer your identity based on the information we collect.\\nLog Information. We may receive information when you view content on or otherwise interact with our products and services, even if you have not created an account or are signed out, such as:\\nIP address and related information; browser type and language; operating system; the referring webpage; access times; pages visited; location; your mobile carrier; device information (including device and application IDs); search terms and IDs (including those not submitted as queries); ads shown to you on X; X-generated identi\\ufb01ers; and identi\\ufb01ers associated with cookies. We also receive log information when you click on, view, or interact with links on our services, including when you install another application through X.\\nAdvertisements. When you view or interact with ads we serve on or o\\ufb00 X, we may collect information about those views or interactions (e.g., watching a video ad or preroll, clicking on an ad, interacting with reposts of or replies to an ad).\\nCookies and similar technologies. Like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to operate our services. Cookies are not required for many parts of our products and services such as searching and looking at public pro\\ufb01les. You can learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies here.\\nInteractions with our content on third-party sites. When you view our content on third-party websites that integrate X content, such as embedded timelines or post buttons, we may receive log information that includes the web page you visited.\\n1.3 Information we receive from third parties.\\nWhen you use other online products and services, they may share information about that usage with us.\\n\\nAd Partners, Developers, Publishers. Our ad and business partners share information with us such as browser cookie IDs, X-generated identifiers, mobile device IDs, hashed user information like email addresses, demographic or interest data, and content viewed or actions taken on a website or app. Some of our ad partners, particularly our advertisers, also enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by integrating our advertising technology. Information shared by ad partners and affiliates or collected by X from the websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may be combined with the other information you share with X and that X receives, generates, or infers about you described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.\\nOther Third Parties, Account Connections, and Integrations. We may receive information about you from third parties who are not our ad partners, such as other X users, developers, and partners who help us evaluate the safety and quality of content on our platform, our corporate affiliates, and other services you link to your X account. You may choose to connect your X account to your account on another service, and that other service may send us information about your account on that service.\\n  2. How We Use Information\\nBreaking down how we use the information we collect is not simple because of the way the systems that bring our services to you work. For example, the same piece of information may be used differently for different purposes to ultimately deliver a single service. We think it\\u2019s most useful to describe the five main ways we use information and if you have questions that are not answered, you can always contact us. Here we go:\\n2.1 Operate, improve, and personalize our services.\\nWe use the information we collect to provide and operate X products and services. We also use the information we collect to improve and personalize our products and services so that you have a better experience on X, including by showing you more relevant content and ads, suggesting people and topics to follow, enabling and helping you discover affiliates, third-party apps, and services. We may use the information we collect and publicly available information to help train our machine learning or artificial intelligence models for the purposes outlined in this policy.\\n\\nWe may use the information we collect from accounts of other services that you choose to connect to your X account to provide you features like cross-posting or cross-service authentication, and to operate our services.\\nWe use your contact information to help others find your account if your settings permit, including through third-party services and client applications.\\nWe use your information to provide our advertising and sponsored content services subject to your settings, which helps make ads on X more relevant to you. We also use this information to measure the effectiveness of ads and to help recognize your devices to serve you ads on and off of X. Some of our ad partners also enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by integrating our advertising technology. Information shared by ad partners and affiliates or collected by X from the websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may be combined with the other information you share with X and that X receives, generates, or infers about you, as described elsewhere in our Privacy Policy.\\n2.2  Foster safety and security.\\nWe use information we collect to provide for the safety and security of our users, our products, services, and your account. This includes verifying your identity, authenticating your account, and defending against fraud, unauthorized use, and illegal activity. We also use the information to evaluate and affect the safety and quality of content on X - this includes investigating and enforcing our policies and and terms, as well as applicable law.\\n2.3 Measure, analyze and make our services better.\\nWe use the information we collect to measure and analyze the effectiveness of our products and services and to better understand how you use them in order to make them better.\\n2.4 Communicate with you about our services.\\nWe use the information we collect to communicate with you about our products and services, including about product updates and changes to our policies and terms. If you\\u2019re open to hearing from us, we may also send you marketing messages from time to time.\\n2.5 Research.\\nWe use information you share with us, or that we collect to conduct research, surveys, product testing, and troubleshooting to help us operate and improve our products and services.\\n  3. Sharing Information\\nYou should know the ways we share your information, why we share it, and how you can control it. There are five general ways we share your information.\\n3.1 When you post and share.\\nWith the general public. You are directing us to disclose that information as broadly as possible. X content, including your profile information (e.g., name/pseudonym, username, profile pictures), is available for viewing by the general public. The public does not need to be signed in to view some content on X. They may also find X content off of X: for example, from search query results on Internet search engines or videos downloaded and reshared elsewhere (depending on your settings).\\n\\nWith other X users. Depending on your settings, and based on the X products and services you use, we share:\\nYour interactions with X content of other users, such as replies, and people you follow.\\nContent you send to a specific X user, such as through Direct Messages. Please keep in mind that if you\\u2019ve shared information like Direct Messages or protected posts with someone else who accesses X through a third-party service, the information may be shared with the third-party service.\\nWith partners. Depending on your settings, we also provide certain third parties with information to help us offer or operate our products and services. You can learn more about these partnerships in our Help Center. You can control whether X shares your personal information with these partners by using the \\u201cData sharing with business partners\\u201d option in your Privacy & Safety settings. (This setting does not control sharing described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, such as when we share information with our service providers, or through partnerships other than as described in this Help Center article.)\\n3.2 With third parties & third-party integrations.\\nWith service providers. We may share your information with our service providers that perform functions and provide services on our behalf, including payment services providers who facilitate payments; service providers that host our various blogs and wikis; service providers that help us understand the use of our services; applicant tracking system providers to send and receive applicant and job data to potential employers; and those that provide fraud detection services. \\nWith advertisers. Advertising revenue enables us to provide our products and services. Advertisers may learn information from your engagement with their ads on or off X. For example, if you click on an external link or ad on our services, that advertiser or website operator might figure out that you came from X, along with other information associated with the ad you clicked, such as characteristics of the audience it was intended to reach and other X-generated identifiers for that ad. They may also collect other personal information from you, such as cookie identifiers, or your IP address.\\nThird-party content & integrations. We share or disclose your information with your consent or at your direction, such as when you authorize a third-party web client or application to access your account or when you direct us to share your feedback with a business. Similarly, to improve your experience, we work with third-party partners to display their video content on X or to allow cross-platform sharing. When you watch or otherwise interact with content from our video or cross-platform sharing partners, they may receive and process your personal information as described in their privacy policies. For video content, you can adjust your autoplay settings if you prefer that content not to play automatically.\\nThird-party collaborators. Depending on your settings, or if you decide to share your data, we may share or disclose your information with third parties. If you do not opt out, in some instances the recipients of the information may use it for their own independent purposes in addition to those stated in X\\u2019s Privacy Policy, including, for example, to train their artificial intelligence models, whether generative or otherwise. \\nThrough our APIs. We use technology like APIs and embeds to make public X information available to websites, apps, and others for their use, for example, displaying posts on a news website or analyzing what people say on X. We generally make this content available in limited quantities for free and charge licensing fees for large-scale access. We have standard terms that govern how this information can be used, and a compliance program to enforce these terms. But these individuals and companies are not affiliated with X, and their offerings may not reflect updates you make on X. For more information about how we make public data on X available to the world, visit https://developer.x.com.\\n3.3 When required by law, to prevent harm, or in the public interest.\\nWe may preserve, use, share, or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to:\\ncomply with a law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request;\\nprotect the safety of any person, protect the safety or integrity of our platform, including to help prevent spam, abuse, or malicious actors on our services;\\nexplain why we have removed content or accounts from our services (e.g., for a violation of our Rules);\\naddress fraud, security, or technical issues; or\\nprotect our rights or property, or the rights or property of those who use our services.\\nWe may also use different signals and your data to infer, preserve, use, share, or disclose your age and identity information in order to comply with regulatory requirements as well as for safety, security, fraud, know-your-customer, know-your-business, and identity verification, as the case may be. We may also share or disclose your age and identity information with our partners, service providers, and others for these purposes.\\n3.4 With our Affiliates.\\nWe may share information amongst our affiliates to provide our products and services.\\n3.5 As a result of a change in ownership.\\nWe may share, sell, or transfer information about you in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of assets, or bankruptcy. This Privacy Policy will apply to your personal information that is shared with (before and after the close of any transaction) or transferred to the new entity.\\n  4. How Long We Keep Information\\nWe keep different types of information for different periods of time, depending on how long we need to retain it in order to provide you with our products and services, to comply with our legal requirements and for safety and security reasons. For example:\\nWe keep your profile information, such as your display name, user name, password and email address for the duration of your account. We cannot provide you with our products and services without retaining this information.\\nWe keep your usage information, such as the content you post, your interactions with other users\\u2019 content and how you interact with others on the platform for the duration of your account or until such content is removed.\\nWe keep your payment information, including your credit or debit card number and billing address for the duration you use our paid products and services. Records of transactions will be kept for longer, in accordance with applicable law.\\nIf you communicate with us, such as through email, we will keep information about the communication and its content for up to 18 months, unless it is necessary for us to retain it for a longer period to comply with our legal obligations or to exercise or defend our legal rights.\\nWe generally collect device information, location information, inferred identity information and log information using cookies. We keep cookies and information collected using cookies for up to 13 months. You can learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies here.\\nWe keep information about your views or interactions with ads on or off X, as well as how you interact with our content on third-party sites for up to 90 days. \\nWe keep information shared by ad and business partners for up to 90 days.\\nWhere you violate our Rules and your account is suspended, we may keep the identifiers you used to create the account (such as your email address or phone number) indefinitely to prevent repeat policy offenders from creating new accounts.\\nWe may need to keep certain information longer than our policies specify in order to comply with legal requirements and for safety and security reasons. For example:\\nTo comply with a law, regulation, legal process or governmental request. Including in order to adhere to a legally appropriate preservation request made by law enforcement. You can read more about law enforcement access here.\\nIn connection with legal claims, litigation and regulatory matters. Including where it is reasonably necessary to retain information relating to your account in order to defend X against legal claims.\\nTo maintain the safety and security of our products and services. Including where it is necessary to store your information longer in order to investigate and fight abuse on our products and services.\\nRemember public content can exist elsewhere even after it is removed from X. For example, search engines and other third parties may retain copies of your posts longer, based upon their own privacy policies, even after they are deleted or expire on X. You can read more about search visibility here.\\n  5. Take Control\\n5.1 Access, Correction, Portability.\\nYou can access, correct, or modify the information you provided to us by editing your profile and adjusting your account settings.\\nYou can learn more about the information we have collected or inferred about you in Your X Data and request access to additional information here.\\nYou can download a copy of your information, such as your posts, by following the instructions here.\\nTo protect your privacy and maintain security, we take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your personal information or complying with a deletion, portability, or other related request. We may, in certain situations, reject your request for access, correction, or portability, for example, we may reject access where you are unable to verify your identity.\\n5.2 Deleting your Information.\\nIf you follow the instructions here, your account will be deactivated and your data will be queued for deletion. When deactivated, your X account, including your display name, username, and public profile, will no longer be viewable on X.com, X for iOS, and X for Android. For up to 30 days after deactivation it is still possible to restore your X account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated.\\n5.3 Objecting to, Restricting, or Withdrawing your Consent.\\nYou can manage your privacy settings and other account features here. If you change your settings it may take some time for your choices to be fully reflected throughout our systems. You may also notice changes in your X experience or limitations in your ability to access certain features depending on the settings you\\u2019ve adjusted. You may also manage additional settings when interacting with certain content and features on different parts of the platform, such as whether a Space is recorded, or whether videos you upload are downloadable by others.\\n5.4 Authorized Agent Requests.\\nTo submit a request related to access, modification, or deletion of your information, or someone else\\u2019s information if you are their authorized agent, you may also contact us as specified in the How To Contact X section of our Privacy Policy below. We may require you to provide additional information for verification.\\n  6. Your Rights and Ours\\nWe provide X to people all over the world and provide many of the same privacy tools and controls to all of our users regardless of where they live.

The third party compares Netflix\\u2019s privacy protected contact information with privacy protected contact information in its own database and there will be a match only if you have used the same contact information with Netflix and the third party. If there is a match, Netflix can then choose whether or not to send Netflix marketing to you on that third party service, and can optimize and better measure the effectiveness of such marketing.

This section explains the types of technologies used, what they do, and your corresponding choices. To choose whether or not to receive cookies and similar technologies, please see the section below \\u201cHow can I exercise choice regarding these technologies?\\u201d\\nCookies and Similar Technologies, Pixel Tags, and Resettable Device Identifiers\\nCookies are small data files that are commonly stored on your device when you access websites and online services. The text in a cookie contains a string of numbers and letters that may uniquely identify a device and can contain other information as well. This allows the web server to recognize your browser each time it connects to that web server.\\nWe use other technologies such as browser storage and plugins (for example, HTML5, IndexedDB, and WebSQL). Like cookies, these other technologies may store small amounts of data on a device. Pixel tags often work in conjunction with cookies. In many cases, declining cookies will impair the effectiveness of pixel tags associated with those cookies.\\nIf you use a Netflix app (such as the main Netflix app, or a Netflix game app) on a mobile device, tablet, or streaming media device, we may collect a resettable device identifier from your device. Resettable device identifiers can be used like cookies and are found on many mobile devices and tablets (for example, the \\u201cIdentifier for Advertisers\\u201d on Apple iOS devices and the \\u201cGoogle Advertising ID\\u201d on Android devices), and certain streaming media devices. Like cookies, resettable device identifiers are used to make online advertising more relevant, and for analytics and optimization purposes.\\nWhy Does Netflix Use These Technologies?\\nWe use these types of technologies for various reasons, including to provide our service (for example, by making it easy to access our service by remembering you when you return); to administer and operate our business, to research, analyze and improve our services (for example, to improve site performance, monitor visitor traffic and actions on our site, and to test the effectiveness of our user interface); to send marketing and informational messages (for example, to deliver and tailor our marketing, and to understand interactions with our emails, marketing, and marketing on third party services); to operate our ad supported subscription plan; for safety, security and fraud prevention; and to comply with law and enforce our Terms of Use. These technologies enable Netflix Marketing Providers to collect personal information (such as the pages you visit and device and network information) when you use our services, and Netflix Marketing Providers may also collect information about your online activities over time across different websites.\\nWe use pixel tags in our emails to understand how members interact with our services. Our use of pixel tags helps us understand when links within messages are clicked, or the emails are opened.\\nNetflix uses resettable device identifiers to display marketing for our service or Netflix content on third party services, and to operate our ad supported subscription plan (including delivering Advertisements to you).\\nTo learn more about the types of cookies used by Netflix, please click here.\\nHow can I exercise choice regarding these technologies?\\nTo exercise choice regarding cookies\\n\\nFor more information about cookies set through our service and to exercise choices regarding cookies, click here. We do not currently respond to web browser \\u201cdo not track\\\" signals.\\nTo exercise choice regarding resettable device identifiers\\n\\nTo exercise choice regarding Netflix\\u2019s use of resettable device identifiers (for marketing the Netflix service or Netflix content, or as used in connection with an ad supported subscription plan), please configure the appropriate setting on your device (usually found under \\\"privacy\\\" or \\\"ads\\\" in your device settings). If you choose not to allow this, you may still see marketing messages promoting Netflix (and Advertisements if you subscribe to an ad supported subscription plan) on that device but it will not be selected based on the use of a resettable device identifier. Note that your choice regarding the resettable device identifier is specific to that device.\\nTo exercise choice regarding other similar technologies\\n\\nIn addition to any choices we may offer you in the Netflix service, there are several ways to exercise choice regarding technologies that are similar to cookies, such as browser storage and plugins (for example, HTML5, IndexedDB, and WebSQL). For example, many popular browsers provide the ability to clear browser storage, typically in the settings or preferences area. See your browser's help function or support area to learn more. Most email clients have settings that allow you to prevent the automatic downloading of images, including pixel tags, and the automatic connection to the web servers that host those images. Other technologies may be cleared from within the application.\\nIn addition to these choices, if you subscribe to an ad supported subscription plan and want to exercise your choices for behavioral advertising on Netflix as part of such plan, please see \\u201cAdvertising Choices (Netflix Ad Supported Subscription Plans)\\u201d above.\\nSection E: Other Important Privacy Disclosures\\nSharing Functionality in our Service\\nYou can use sharing functionality available in our service to disclose your personal information in the following ways:\\ncertain portions of our service may give you options to share information by email, text message, and social or other sharing applications, using the clients and apps on your device; and\\nsocial plugins and similar technologies that allow you to share information.\\nSocial plugins and social applications are operated by third-party social networks, and are subject to their terms of use and privacy policies.

Signing in to your Microsoft account enables personalization and consistent experiences across products and devices, permits you to use cloud data storage, allows you to make payments using payment instruments stored in your Microsoft account, and enables other features.\\nThere are three types of Microsoft account:\\nWhen you create your own Microsoft account tied to your personal email address, we refer to that account as a personal Microsoft account.\\nWhen you or your organization (such as an employer or your school) create your Microsoft account tied to your email address provided by that organization, we refer to that account as a work or school account.\\nWhen you or your service provider (such as a cable or internet service provider) create your Microsoft account tied to your email address with your service provider\\u2019s domain, we refer to that account as a third-party account.\\nIf you sign into a service offered by a third party with your Microsoft account, you will share with that third party the account data required by that service.\\nLearn more\\nBack to top\\nCollection of data from children\\nFor users under the age of 13 or as specified by law in their jurisdiction, certain Microsoft products and services will either block users under that age or will ask them to obtain consent or authorization from a parent or guardian before they can use it, including when creating an account to access Microsoft services. We will not knowingly ask children under that age to provide more data than is required to provide for the product.\\nOnce parental consent or authorization is granted, the child's account is treated much like any other account. Learn more about personal and school accounts in the Microsoft account section of the Privacy Statement and Microsoft Family Safety in the product-specific section. The child can access communication services, like Outlook and Skype, and can freely communicate and share data with other users of all ages. Parents or guardians can change or revoke the consent choices previously made. Learn more about parental consent and Microsoft child accounts. As the organizer of a Microsoft family group, the parent or guardian can manage their child\\u2019s information and settings on their Family Safety page and view and delete a child\\u2019s data on their privacy dashboard. Accounts that require parental consent to be created are automatically included as part of the family group of the individual who provided the consent for account creation. For child accounts that do not require parental consent to be created, (e.g., for children who are over the age at which parental consent is legally required), the parent or guardian may still use a family group, but must add the child account to their family group after the account is created. Select Learn more below for more information about how to access and delete child data and information about children and Xbox profiles.\\nLearn more\\nBack to top\\nOther important privacy information\\nBelow you will find additional privacy information, such as how we secure your data, where we process your data, and how long we retain your data. You can find more information on Microsoft and our commitment to protecting your privacy at Microsoft Privacy.\\nLearn more\\nBack to top\\nArtificial Intelligence and Microsoft Copilot capabilities\\nMicrosoft leverages the power of artificial intelligence (AI) in many of our products and services, including by incorporating generative AI features such as Microsoft Copilot capabilities. Microsoft\\u2019s deployment and use of AI is subject to Microsoft\\u2019s AI Principles and Microsoft\\u2019s Responsible AI Standard, and Microsoft\\u2019s collection and use of personal data in developing and deploying AI features is consistent with commitments outlined in this privacy statement. Product-specific details provide additional relevant information. You can find out more about how Microsoft uses AI here.\\nMicrosoft Copilot capabilities. Microsoft Copilot is Microsoft\\u2019s everyday AI companion, and is designed to help you achieve more through a single experience that runs across devices, understanding relevant context on the web, on your PC, and across apps to bring you the right skills at the right time. With the help of Copilot, users can start a draft of a new Word document; or generate a PowerPoint presentation when accessing Copilot in M365 apps, quickly find the answers to complex search queries online, find relevant documents or other personal content, or be inspired to create new songs, stories, images, or other content, among other tasks. Copilot is a family of services, and Microsoft\\u2019s collection and use of data may differ depending on the service and the intended functionality in a given scenario.\\nThe Copilot website and app (available on iOS and Android) is the core of the consumer Copilot experience. Within this core experience, users can search the web, create text, images, songs, or other outputs, or engage with other features, such as plugins. On the website and in the app, users enter \\u201cprompts\\u201d that provide instructions to Copilot (e.g., \\u201cGive me recommendations for a restaurant that accommodates parties of 10 near me\\u201d). In order to provide a relevant response, Copilot will use this prompt, along with the user\\u2019s location, language, and similar settings, to formulate a helpful response. In some markets, authenticated users can choose to allow Copilot to have access to prior prompt history to better personalize the product. The consumer Copilot product uses the data collected to provide and improve the Copilot services, including to provide relevant advertising. Users who are signed-in to their account can manage their prompt history in product and on the Microsoft Privacy Dashboard, and can adjust their location, language, and other settings in the product.\\nCopilot also appears as an assistant within other Microsoft consumer products, such as Bing and Microsoft Edge. In those situations, data processing activities generally align with those products\\u2019 primary uses. For example, Copilot in Bing\\u2019s use and collection of personal data is consistent with Bing\\u2019s core web search offering as described in the Search and Browse section of this privacy statement. More information about Copilot in Bing is available at Copilot in Bing: Our approach to Responsible AI. In Microsoft Edge, Copilot appears in the sidebar experience and can help the user complete tasks related to the webpages they visit (e.g., \\u201csummarize this page\\u201d). This data is used consistent with the Microsoft Edge section of this privacy statement.\\nCopilot Pro is another consumer Copilot offering, and offers subscribers priority access to the very latest models, improved image creation abilities, and access to Copilot in Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, OneNote, Excel, and Outlook. The main Copilot Pro website and app has similar data collection, use, and controls as consumer Copilot, as described above. Similar Copilot functionality is also included in Microsoft 365 Family and Microsoft 365 Personal subscriptions. When Copilot is integrated with Microsoft 365 products, Copilot data collection is consistent with how data collection and use is described in the Productivity and Communications section of this privacy statement.\\nThere are also Copilot offerings designed for enterprise users. When enabled by an eligible enterprise, users logged in with their Entra ID who want to access consumer Copilot services are offered Copilot with Commercial Data Protection, which minimizes data collection and use consistent with the expectations of enterprise users. More information on Copilot with Commercial Data Protection is available here.\\nMicrosoft 365 Copilot, available for Microsoft 365 enterprise offerings, provides enterprise-grade data protection along with access to the corporate graph, Copilot within Microsoft 365 and Teams, and additional customization features. Data collection and use in Microsoft 365 Copilot is consistent with the practices described in the Enterprise and Developer Products section of this privacy statement.\\nBack to top\\nEnterprise and developer products\\nEnterprise and Developer Products are Microsoft products and related software offered to and designed primarily for use by organizations and developers.

Rather than residing as a static software program on your device, key components of Windows are cloud-based, and both cloud and local elements of Windows are updated regularly, providing you with the latest improvements and features. In order to provide this computing experience, we collect data about you, your device, and the way you use Windows. And because Windows is personal to you, we give you choices about the personal data we collect and how we use it. Note that if your Windows device is managed by your organization (such as your employer or school), your organization may use centralized management tools provided by Microsoft or others to access and process your data and to control device settings (including privacy settings), device policies, software updates, data collection by us or the organization, or other aspects of your device. Additionally, your organization may use management tools provided by Microsoft or others to access and process your data from that device, including your interaction data, diagnostic data, and the contents of your communications and files.\\nThe Windows Settings, formerly known as PC Settings, is an essential component of Microsoft Windows. It provides a convenient interface for adjusting user preferences, configuring the operating system, and managing connected devices so that you can manage user accounts, adjust network settings, and personalize various aspects of Windows. Windows provides a mechanism for apps to access various device capabilities such as the device\\u2019s camera, microphone, location, calendar, contacts, call history, messages and more, while controlling access to your personal data. Each capability has its own privacy settings page in Windows settings, so you can control which apps can use each capability. Here are some key features of Settings:\\nCustomization: You can personalize various aspects of Windows, including the look and feel, language settings, and privacy options. Windows settings uses your microphone when controlling the volume, camera when using integrated camera and location to change brightness at night time to help you customize your Windows.\\nPeripheral Management: Install and manage peripherals such as printers, monitors, and external drives.\\nNetwork Configuration: Adjust networking settings, including Wi-Fi, Ethernet, cellular and VPN connections and will use physical MAC address, IMEI and mobile number if device supports cellular.\\nAccount Management: Add or remove user accounts, change account settings, and manage sign-in options.\\nSystem-Level Options: Configure display settings, notifications, power options, manage list of installed apps and more.\\nPrivacy & security management: configure your privacy preferences such as location, collection of diagnostic data etc. Fine-tune which individual apps and services can access device capabilities by turning them on or off.\\nFor more information about data collection in Windows, see Data collection summary for Windows. This statement discusses Windows 10 and Windows 11 and references to Windows in this section relate to those product versions. Earlier versions of Windows (including Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1) are subject to their own privacy statements.\\nLearn more\\nBack to top\\nEntertainment and related services\\nEntertainment and Related Services power rich experiences and enable you to access a variety of content, applications and games.\\nLearn more\\nBack to top\\nBack To Top\\nYour Privacy Choices\\nConsumer Health Privacy\\nSitemap Contact Microsoft Privacy Terms of use Trademarks Safety & eco Recycling About our ads \\u00a9 Microsoft 2025\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Word Count\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 2277,\n        \"min\": 4726,\n        \"max\": 10272,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          5434,\n          8612,\n          4726\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Avg Sentence Length\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 5.142128364752962,\n        \"min\": 16.634615384615383,\n        \"max\": 28.42809364548495,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          19.153024911032027,\n          28.42809364548495,\n          22.504807692307693\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Keyword Frequency\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Flesch Reading Ease\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 8.093412753591652,\n        \"min\": 21.77,\n        \"max\": 41.8,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          39.77,\n          21.77,\n          29.79\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Gunning Fog Index\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1.5491061939066666,\n        \"min\": 10.43,\n        \"max\": 14.7,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          11.73,\n          14.7,\n          12.33\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"SMOG Index\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1.6164776521808155,\n        \"min\": 14.3,\n        \"max\": 18.6,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          15.2,\n          18.6,\n          16.5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Complex Words %\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 2.0317470032205187,\n        \"min\": 6.695592150675476,\n        \"max\": 11.545064377682404,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          10.919970082273748,\n          7.924305144884683,\n          11.545064377682404\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Deception Score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 6.252987850800991,\n        \"min\": 27.521266094420604,\n        \"max\": 44.46357628622117,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          35.21999252056844,\n          44.46357628622117,\n          27.521266094420604\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Source\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Current Website\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Information We Collect\\nThe information we collect when you use X falls into three categories.\\n1.1 Information you provide us.\\nTo use some of our products and services you need to have an account, and to create an account, you need to provide us certain information. Likewise, if you use our paid products and services, we cannot provide them to you without getting payment information. Basically, certain information is necessary if you want to use many of our products and services.\\nPersonal Accounts. If you create an account, you must provide us with some information so that we can provide our services to you. This includes a display name (for example, \\u201cCreators\\u201d); a username (for example, @XCreators); a password; an email address or phone number; a date of birth; your display language; and third-party single sign-in information (if you choose this sign-in method). You can also choose to share your location in your profile and posts, and to upload your address book to X to help find people you may know. Your profile information, which includes your display name and username, is always public, but you can use either your real name or a pseudonym. And remember, you can create multiple X accounts, for example, to express different parts of your identity, professional or otherwise. \\nProfessional Accounts. If you create a professional account, you also need to provide us with a professional category, and may provide us with other information, including street address, contact email address, and contact phone number, all of which will always be public. \\nPayment Information. In order to purchase ads or other offerings provided as part of our paid products and services you will need to provide us payment information, including your credit or debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address.\\nPreferences.

You can learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies here.\\nInteractions with our content on third-party sites.

You may choose to connect your X account to your account on another service, and that other service may send us information about your account on that service.\\n  2. How We Use Information\\nBreaking down how we use the information we collect is not simple because of the way the systems that bring our services to you work. For example, the same piece of information may be used differently for different purposes to ultimately deliver a single service. We think it\\u2019s most useful to describe the five main ways we use information and if you have questions that are not answered, you can always contact us. Here we go:\\n2.1 Operate, improve, and personalize our services.\\nWe use the information we collect to provide and operate X products and services. We also use the information we collect to improve and personalize our products and services so that you have a better experience on X, including by showing you more relevant content and ads, suggesting people and topics to follow, enabling and helping you discover affiliates, third-party apps, and services. We may use the information we collect and publicly available information to help train our machine learning or artificial intelligence models for the purposes outlined in this policy.\\n\\nWe may use the information we collect from accounts of other services that you choose to connect to your X account to provide you features like cross-posting or cross-service authentication, and to operate our services.\\nWe use your contact information to help others find your account if your settings permit, including through third-party services and client applications.\\nWe use your information to provide our advertising and sponsored content services subject to your settings, which helps make ads on X more relevant to you. We also use this information to measure the effectiveness of ads and to help recognize your devices to serve you ads on and off of X. Some of our ad partners also enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by integrating our advertising technology. Information shared by ad partners and affiliates or collected by X from the websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may be combined with the other information you share with X and that X receives, generates, or infers about you, as described elsewhere in our Privacy Policy.\\n2.2  Foster safety and security.\\nWe use information we collect to provide for the safety and security of our users, our products, services, and your account. This includes verifying your identity, authenticating your account, and defending against fraud, unauthorized use, and illegal activity. We also use the information to evaluate and affect the safety and quality of content on X - this includes investigating and enforcing our policies and and terms, as well as applicable law.\\n2.3 Measure, analyze and make our services better.\\nWe use the information we collect to measure and analyze the effectiveness of our products and services and to better understand how you use them in order to make them better.\\n2.4 Communicate with you about our services.\\nWe use the information we collect to communicate with you about our products and services, including about product updates and changes to our policies and terms. If you\\u2019re open to hearing from us, we may also send you marketing messages from time to time.\\n2.5 Research.\\nWe use information you share with us, or that we collect to conduct research, surveys, product testing, and troubleshooting to help us operate and improve our products and services.\\n  3. Sharing Information\\nYou should know the ways we share your information, why we share it, and how you can control it. There are five general ways we share your information.\\n3.1 When you post and share.\\nWith the general public. You are directing us to disclose that information as broadly as possible. X content, including your profile information (e.g., name/pseudonym, username, profile pictures), is available for viewing by the general public. The public does not need to be signed in to view some content on X. They may also find X content off of X: for example, from search query results on Internet search engines or videos downloaded and reshared elsewhere (depending on your settings).\\n\\nWith other X users. Depending on your settings, and based on the X products and services you use, we share:\\nYour interactions with X content of other users, such as replies, and people you follow.\\nContent you send to a specific X user, such as through Direct Messages. Please keep in mind that if you\\u2019ve shared information like Direct Messages or protected posts with someone else who accesses X through a third-party service, the information may be shared with the third-party service.\\nWith partners. Depending on your settings, we also provide certain third parties with information to help us offer or operate our products and services. You can learn more about these partnerships in our Help Center. You can control whether X shares your personal information with these partners by using the \\u201cData sharing with business partners\\u201d option in your Privacy & Safety settings. (This setting does not control sharing described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, such as when we share information with our service providers, or through partnerships other than as described in this Help Center article.)\\n3.2 With third parties & third-party integrations.\\nWith service providers. We may share your information with our service providers that perform functions and provide services on our behalf, including payment services providers who facilitate payments; service providers that host our various blogs and wikis; service providers that help us understand the use of our services; applicant tracking system providers to send and receive applicant and job data to potential employers; and those that provide fraud detection services. \\nWith advertisers. Advertising revenue enables us to provide our products and services. Advertisers may learn information from your engagement with their ads on or off X. For example, if you click on an external link or ad on our services, that advertiser or website operator might figure out that you came from X, along with other information associated with the ad you clicked, such as characteristics of the audience it was intended to reach and other X-generated identifiers for that ad. They may also collect other personal information from you, such as cookie identifiers, or your IP address.\\nThird-party content & integrations. We share or disclose your information with your consent or at your direction, such as when you authorize a third-party web client or application to access your account or when you direct us to share your feedback with a business. Similarly, to improve your experience, we work with third-party partners to display their video content on X or to allow cross-platform sharing. When you watch or otherwise interact with content from our video or cross-platform sharing partners, they may receive and process your personal information as described in their privacy policies. For video content, you can adjust your autoplay settings if you prefer that content not to play automatically.\\nThird-party collaborators. Depending on your settings, or if you decide to share your data, we may share or disclose your information with third parties. If you do not opt out, in some instances the recipients of the information may use it for their own independent purposes in addition to those stated in X\\u2019s Privacy Policy, including, for example, to train their artificial intelligence models, whether generative or otherwise. \\nThrough our APIs. We use technology like APIs and embeds to make public X information available to websites, apps, and others for their use, for example, displaying posts on a news website or analyzing what people say on X. We generally make this content available in limited quantities for free and charge licensing fees for large-scale access. We have standard terms that govern how this information can be used, and a compliance program to enforce these terms. But these individuals and companies are not affiliated with X, and their offerings may not reflect updates you make on X. For more information about how we make public data on X available to the world, visit https://developer.x.com.\\n3.3 When required by law, to prevent harm, or in the public interest.\\nWe may preserve, use, share, or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to:\\ncomply with a law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request;\\nprotect the safety of any person, protect the safety or integrity of our platform, including to help prevent spam, abuse, or malicious actors on our services;\\nexplain why we have removed content or accounts from our services (e.g., for a violation of our Rules);\\naddress fraud, security, or technical issues; or\\nprotect our rights or property, or the rights or property of those who use our services.\\nWe may also use different signals and your data to infer, preserve, use, share, or disclose your age and identity information in order to comply with regulatory requirements as well as for safety, security, fraud, know-your-customer, know-your-business, and identity verification, as the case may be. We may also share or disclose your age and identity information with our partners, service providers, and others for these purposes.\\n3.4 With our Affiliates.\\nWe may share information amongst our affiliates to provide our products and services.\\n3.5 As a result of a change in ownership.\\nWe may share, sell, or transfer information about you in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of assets, or bankruptcy. This Privacy Policy will apply to your personal information that is shared with (before and after the close of any transaction) or transferred to the new entity.\\n  4. How Long We Keep Information\\nWe keep different types of information for different periods of time, depending on how long we need to retain it in order to provide you with our products and services, to comply with our legal requirements and for safety and security reasons. For example:\\nWe keep your profile information, such as your display name, user name, password and email address for the duration of your account. We cannot provide you with our products and services without retaining this information.\\nWe keep your usage information, such as the content you post, your interactions with other users\\u2019 content and how you interact with others on the platform for the duration of your account or until such content is removed.\\nWe keep your payment information, including your credit or debit card number and billing address for the duration you use our paid products and services. Records of transactions will be kept for longer, in accordance with applicable law.\\nIf you communicate with us, such as through email, we will keep information about the communication and its content for up to 18 months, unless it is necessary for us to retain it for a longer period to comply with our legal obligations or to exercise or defend our legal rights.\\nWe generally collect device information, location information, inferred identity information and log information using cookies. We keep cookies and information collected using cookies for up to 13 months. You can learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies here.\\nWe keep information about your views or interactions with ads on or off X, as well as how you interact with our content on third-party sites for up to 90 days. \\nWe keep information shared by ad and business partners for up to 90 days.\\nWhere you violate our Rules and your account is suspended, we may keep the identifiers you used to create the account (such as your email address or phone number) indefinitely to prevent repeat policy offenders from creating new accounts.\\nWe may need to keep certain information longer than our policies specify in order to comply with legal requirements and for safety and security reasons. For example:\\nTo comply with a law, regulation, legal process or governmental request. Including in order to adhere to a legally appropriate preservation request made by law enforcement. You can read more about law enforcement access here.\\nIn connection with legal claims, litigation and regulatory matters. Including where it is reasonably necessary to retain information relating to your account in order to defend X against legal claims.\\nTo maintain the safety and security of our products and services. Including where it is necessary to store your information longer in order to investigate and fight abuse on our products and services.\\nRemember public content can exist elsewhere even after it is removed from X. For example, search engines and other third parties may retain copies of your posts longer, based upon their own privacy policies, even after they are deleted or expire on X. You can read more about search visibility here.\\n  5. Take Control\\n5.1 Access, Correction, Portability.\\nYou can access, correct, or modify the information you provided to us by editing your profile and adjusting your account settings.\\nYou can learn more about the information we have collected or inferred about you in Your X Data and request access to additional information here.\\nYou can download a copy of your information, such as your posts, by following the instructions here.\\nTo protect your privacy and maintain security, we take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your personal information or complying with a deletion, portability, or other related request. We may, in certain situations, reject your request for access, correction, or portability, for example, we may reject access where you are unable to verify your identity.\\n5.2 Deleting your Information.\\nIf you follow the instructions here, your account will be deactivated and your data will be queued for deletion. When deactivated, your X account, including your display name, username, and public profile, will no longer be viewable on X.com, X for iOS, and X for Android. For up to 30 days after deactivation it is still possible to restore your X account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated.\\n5.3 Objecting to, Restricting, or Withdrawing your Consent.\\nYou can manage your privacy settings and other account features here. If you change your settings it may take some time for your choices to be fully reflected throughout our systems. You may also notice changes in your X experience or limitations in your ability to access certain features depending on the settings you\\u2019ve adjusted. You may also manage additional settings when interacting with certain content and features on different parts of the platform, such as whether a Space is recorded, or whether videos you upload are downloadable by others.\\n5.4 Authorized Agent Requests.\\nTo submit a request related to access, modification, or deletion of your information, or someone else\\u2019s information if you are their authorized agent, you may also contact us as specified in the How To Contact X section of our Privacy Policy below. We may require you to provide additional information for verification.\\n  6. Your Rights and Ours\\nWe provide X to people all over the world and provide many of the same privacy tools and controls to all of our users regardless of where they live. However, your experience may be slightly different than users in other countries to ensure X respects local requirements.\\n6.1 We have specific legal bases to use your information.\\nX has carefully considered the legal reasons it is permitted to collect, use, share and otherwise process your information. If you want to dig in to learn more and better understand the nuances, we\\u2019d encourage you to check out this additional information about data processing. And no, we don\\u2019t sell your personal information. \\n6.2 We move your data to make X work for you.\\nJust as you use X to seamlessly participate in global conversations with people in countries all over the world, X must move information across borders and to different countries around the world to support the safe and reliable service you depend on. For example, if you live in Europe and are having a conversation with someone in the United States, information has to move between those countries to provide that experience \\u2013 it\\u2019s what you expect from us.\\nWe also use data centers and cloud providers, and engage our affiliates and third-party partners and service providers located in many parts of the world to help us provide our services. Before we move data between countries we look at the risks that may be presented to the data and rely on standard contractual clauses (SCCs), where applicable, to ensure your data rights are protected. To request a copy of the SCCs, please contact us here. If data will be shared with a third party, we require them to maintain the same protections over your data that we provide directly.\\nX is a participant in the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (DPF), the Swiss-US DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-US DPF. X complies with the DPF Principles for all its processing of personal data received from the European Union, Switzerland and the UK, in reliance on the EU-US DPF, Swiss-US DPF and UK Extension to the EU-US DPF, respectively. If you have an inquiry or complaint related to our participation in the DPF, please contact us here. As part of our participation in the DPF, if you have a dispute with us about our adherence to the DPF Principles, we will seek to resolve it through our internal complaint resolution process, alternatively through the US-based independent dispute resolution body JAMS, and under certain conditions, through the DPF Arbitration Process following the procedures and subject to the conditions described in Annex 1 to the DPF Principles. DPF participants are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade Commission and other authorized statutory bodies. Under certain circumstances, participants may be liable for the transfer of personal data from the EU, Switzerland and the UK to third parties outside the EU, Switzerland and the UK. Learn more about the EU-US DPF, the Swiss-US DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-US DPF here.\\n  7. X's Audience\\nOur services are not directed to children, and you may not use our services if you are under the age of 13. You must also be old enough to consent to the processing of your personal data in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you become aware that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us here. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we take steps to remove such information and terminate the child\\u2019s account. You can find additional resources for parents and teens here.\\n  8. Changes To This Privacy Policy\\nThe most current version of this Privacy Policy governs our processing of your personal data and we may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time as needed.\\nIf we do revise this Privacy Policy and make changes that are determined by us to be material, we will provide you notice and an opportunity to review the revised Privacy Policy before you continue to use X.\\n  9.

The third party compares Netflix\\u2019s privacy protected contact information with privacy protected contact information in its own database and there will be a match only if you have used the same contact information with Netflix and the third party. If there is a match, Netflix can then choose whether or not to send Netflix marketing to you on that third party service, and can optimize and better measure the effectiveness of such marketing.

To choose whether or not to receive cookies and similar technologies, please see the section below \\u201cHow can I exercise choice regarding these technologies?\\u201d\\nCookies and Similar Technologies, Pixel Tags, and Resettable Device Identifiers\\nCookies are small data files that are commonly stored on your device when you access websites and online services.

This allows the web server to recognize your browser each time it connects to that web server.\\nWe use other technologies such as browser storage and plugins (for example, HTML5, IndexedDB, and WebSQL). Like cookies, these other technologies may store small amounts of data on a device. Pixel tags often work in conjunction with cookies. In many cases, declining cookies will impair the effectiveness of pixel tags associated with those cookies.\\nIf you use a Netflix app (such as the main Netflix app, or a Netflix game app) on a mobile device, tablet, or streaming media device, we may collect a resettable device identifier from your device. Resettable device identifiers can be used like cookies and are found on many mobile devices and tablets (for example, the \\u201cIdentifier for Advertisers\\u201d on Apple iOS devices and the \\u201cGoogle Advertising ID\\u201d on Android devices), and certain streaming media devices. Like cookies, resettable device identifiers are used to make online advertising more relevant, and for analytics and optimization purposes.\\nWhy Does Netflix Use These Technologies?\\nWe use these types of technologies for various reasons, including to provide our service (for example, by making it easy to access our service by remembering you when you return); to administer and operate our business, to research, analyze and improve our services (for example, to improve site performance, monitor visitor traffic and actions on our site, and to test the effectiveness of our user interface); to send marketing and informational messages (for example, to deliver and tailor our marketing, and to understand interactions with our emails, marketing, and marketing on third party services); to operate our ad supported subscription plan; for safety, security and fraud prevention; and to comply with law and enforce our Terms of Use. These technologies enable Netflix Marketing Providers to collect personal information (such as the pages you visit and device and network information) when you use our services, and Netflix Marketing Providers may also collect information about your online activities over time across different websites.\\nWe use pixel tags in our emails to understand how members interact with our services. Our use of pixel tags helps us understand when links within messages are clicked, or the emails are opened.\\nNetflix uses resettable device identifiers to display marketing for our service or Netflix content on third party services, and to operate our ad supported subscription plan (including delivering Advertisements to you).\\nTo learn more about the types of cookies used by Netflix, please click here.\\nHow can I exercise choice regarding these technologies?\\nTo exercise choice regarding cookies\\n\\nFor more information about cookies set through our service and to exercise choices regarding cookies, click here.

If you choose not to allow this, you may still see marketing messages promoting Netflix (and Advertisements if you subscribe to an ad supported subscription plan) on that device but it will not be selected based on the use of a resettable device identifier. Note that your choice regarding the resettable device identifier is specific to that device.\\nTo exercise choice regarding other similar technologies\\n\\nIn addition to any choices we may offer you in the Netflix service, there are several ways to exercise choice regarding technologies that are similar to cookies, such as browser storage and plugins (for example, HTML5, IndexedDB, and WebSQL). For example, many popular browsers provide the ability to clear browser storage, typically in the settings or preferences area. See your browser's help function or support area to learn more. Most email clients have settings that allow you to prevent the automatic downloading of images, including pixel tags, and the automatic connection to the web servers that host those images. Other technologies may be cleared from within the application.\\nIn addition to these choices, if you subscribe to an ad supported subscription plan and want to exercise your choices for behavioral advertising on Netflix as part of such plan, please see \\u201cAdvertising Choices (Netflix Ad Supported Subscription Plans)\\u201d above.\\nSection E: Other Important Privacy Disclosures\\nSharing Functionality in our Service\\nYou can use sharing functionality available in our service to disclose your personal information in the following ways:\\ncertain portions of our service may give you options to share information by email, text message, and social or other sharing applications, using the clients and apps on your device; and\\nsocial plugins and similar technologies that allow you to share information.\\nSocial plugins and social applications are operated by third-party social networks, and are subject to their terms of use and privacy policies.

Microsoft\\u2019s deployment and use of AI is subject to Microsoft\\u2019s AI Principles and Microsoft\\u2019s Responsible AI Standard, and Microsoft\\u2019s collection and use of personal data in developing and deploying AI features is consistent with commitments outlined in this privacy statement. Product-specific details provide additional relevant information. You can find out more about how Microsoft uses AI here.\\nMicrosoft Copilot capabilities. Microsoft Copilot is Microsoft\\u2019s everyday AI companion, and is designed to help you achieve more through a single experience that runs across devices, understanding relevant context on the web, on your PC, and across apps to bring you the right skills at the right time. With the help of Copilot, users can start a draft of a new Word document; or generate a PowerPoint presentation when accessing Copilot in M365 apps, quickly find the answers to complex search queries online, find relevant documents or other personal content, or be inspired to create new songs, stories, images, or other content, among other tasks. Copilot is a family of services, and Microsoft\\u2019s collection and use of data may differ depending on the service and the intended functionality in a given scenario.\\nThe Copilot website and app (available on iOS and Android) is the core of the consumer Copilot experience. Within this core experience, users can search the web, create text, images, songs, or other outputs, or engage with other features, such as plugins. On the website and in the app, users enter \\u201cprompts\\u201d that provide instructions to Copilot (e.g., \\u201cGive me recommendations for a restaurant that accommodates parties of 10 near me\\u201d). In order to provide a relevant response, Copilot will use this prompt, along with the user\\u2019s location, language, and similar settings, to formulate a helpful response. In some markets, authenticated users can choose to allow Copilot to have access to prior prompt history to better personalize the product. The consumer Copilot product uses the data collected to provide and improve the Copilot services, including to provide relevant advertising. Users who are signed-in to their account can manage their prompt history in product and on the Microsoft Privacy Dashboard, and can adjust their location, language, and other settings in the product.\\nCopilot also appears as an assistant within other Microsoft consumer products, such as Bing and Microsoft Edge. In those situations, data processing activities generally align with those products\\u2019 primary uses. For example, Copilot in Bing\\u2019s use and collection of personal data is consistent with Bing\\u2019s core web search offering as described in the Search and Browse section of this privacy statement. More information about Copilot in Bing is available at Copilot in Bing: Our approach to Responsible AI. In Microsoft Edge, Copilot appears in the sidebar experience and can help the user complete tasks related to the webpages they visit (e.g., \\u201csummarize this page\\u201d). This data is used consistent with the Microsoft Edge section of this privacy statement.\\nCopilot Pro is another consumer Copilot offering, and offers subscribers priority access to the very latest models, improved image creation abilities, and access to Copilot in Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, OneNote, Excel, and Outlook. The main Copilot Pro website and app has similar data collection, use, and controls as consumer Copilot, as described above. Similar Copilot functionality is also included in Microsoft 365 Family and Microsoft 365 Personal subscriptions. When Copilot is integrated with Microsoft 365 products, Copilot data collection is consistent with how data collection and use is described in the Productivity and Communications section of this privacy statement.\\nThere are also Copilot offerings designed for enterprise users. When enabled by an eligible enterprise, users logged in with their Entra ID who want to access consumer Copilot services are offered Copilot with Commercial Data Protection, which minimizes data collection and use consistent with the expectations of enterprise users. More information on Copilot with Commercial Data Protection is available here.\\nMicrosoft 365 Copilot, available for Microsoft 365 enterprise offerings, provides enterprise-grade data protection along with access to the corporate graph, Copilot within Microsoft 365 and Teams, and additional customization features. Data collection and use in Microsoft 365 Copilot is consistent with the practices described in the Enterprise and Developer Products section of this privacy statement.\\nBack to top\\nEnterprise and developer products\\nEnterprise and Developer Products are Microsoft products and related software offered to and designed primarily for use by organizations and developers.

We understand this is a big responsibility and work hard to protect your information and put you in control.\\nThis Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information.\\nPrivacy Checkup\\nLooking to change your privacy settings?\\nTake the Privacy Checkup\\nEffective September 16, 2024 | Archived versions | Download PDF\\nContents\\nIntroduction\\nInformation Google collects\\nWhy Google collects data\\nYour privacy controls\\nSharing your information\\nKeeping your information secure\\nExporting & deleting your information\\nRetaining your information\\nCompliance & cooperation with regulators\\nAbout this policy\\nRelated privacy practices\\nWe build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:\\nGoogle apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home\\nPlatforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system\\nProducts that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps\\nYou can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you\\u2019re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like Chrome Incognito mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.\\nTo help explain things as clearly as possible, we\\u2019ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for key terms. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us.\\nINFORMATION GOOGLE COLLECTS\\nWe want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services\\nWe collect information to provide better services to all our users \\u2014 from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you\\u2019ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.\\nWhen you\\u2019re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you\\u2019re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.\\nWhen you\\u2019re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information.\\nThings you create or provide to us\\nWhen you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account. Even if you aren\\u2019t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information \\u2014 like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.\\nWe also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services. This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.\\nInformation we collect as you use our services\\nYour apps, browsers & devices\\nWe collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.\\nThe information we collect includes unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request.\\nWe collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers \\u2014 for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you\\u2019re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your device type and carrier name, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings, other information about how you\\u2019re using your Android device.\\nYour activity\\nWe collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:\\nTerms you search for\\nVideos you watch\\nViews and interactions with content and ads\\nVoice and audio information\\nPurchase activity\\nPeople with whom you communicate or share content\\nActivity on third-party sites and apps that use our services\\nChrome browsing history you\\u2019ve synced with your Google Account\\nIf you use our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.\\nYou can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that\\u2019s saved in your account.\\nGo to Google Account\\nYour location information\\nWe collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.\\nDepending on the products you\\u2019re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:\\nGPS and other sensor data from your device\\nIP address\\nActivity on Google services, such as from your searches or places you label like home or work\\nInformation about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices\\nThe types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device\\u2019s location on or off using the device\\u2019s settings app. You can also turn on Location History if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about how we use location information.\\nIn some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google\\u2019s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google\\u2019s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse. We also receive information from partners to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.\\nWe use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases, and server logs.\\nWHY GOOGLE COLLECTS DATA\\nWe use data to build better services\\nWe use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:\\nProvide our services\\nWe use your information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.\\nMaintain & improve our services\\nWe also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services \\u2014 for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.\\nDevelop new services\\nWe use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google\\u2019s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.\\nProvide personalized services, including content and ads\\nWe use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results. For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you\\u2019ve already installed and videos you\\u2019ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.\\nDepending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for \\u201cmountain bikes,\\u201d you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in My Ad Center.\\nWe don\\u2019t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.\\nWe don\\u2019t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.\\nWe don\\u2019t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the \\u201ctap to call\\u201d button, we\\u2019ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.\\nGo to My Ad Center\\nMeasure performance\\nWe use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to link information about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.\\nCommunicate with you\\nWe use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we\\u2019ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.\\nProtect Google, our users, and the public\\nWe use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.\\nWe use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.\\nWe may use the information we collect across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google\\u2019s services and the ads delivered by Google.\\nIf other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.\\nWe\\u2019ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn\\u2019t covered in this Privacy Policy.\\nYOUR PRIVACY CONTROLS\\nYou have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used\\nThis section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the Privacy Checkup, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products \\u2014 you can learn more in our Product Privacy Guide.\\nGo to Privacy Checkup\\nManaging, reviewing, and updating your information\\nWhen you\\u2019re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use.

Your Google Account includes:\\nPrivacy controls\\nActivity Controls\\nDecide what types of activity you\\u2019d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.\\nGo to Activity Controls\\nAd settings\\nManage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.

For example, you can modify location settings on your Android device.\\nSHARING YOUR INFORMATION\\nWhen you share your information\\nMany of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.\\nWhen you\\u2019re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity.

For example, if you use Google Home to make a reservation through a booking service, we\\u2019ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to review and manage third party apps and sites you have given access to data in your Google Account. We\\u2019ll ask for your explicit consent to share any sensitive personal information.\\nWith domain administrators\\nIf you\\u2019re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your domain administrator and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account.

We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google\\u2019s audio recognition technologies.\\nFor legal reasons\\nWe will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:\\nRespond to any applicable law, regulation,legal process, or enforceable governmental request. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our Transparency Report.\\nEnforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.\\nDetect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.\\nProtect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users, or the public.\\nWe may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners \\u2014 like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services. We also allow specific partners to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.\\nIf Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we\\u2019ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.\\nKEEPING YOUR INFORMATION SECURE\\nWe build security into our services to protect your information\\nAll Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information.

Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.\\nEXPORTING & DELETING YOUR INFORMATION\\nYou can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time\\nYou can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.\\nExport your data\\nTo delete your information, you can:\\nDelete your content from specific Google services\\nSearch for and then delete specific items from your account using My Activity\\nDelete specific Google products, including your information associated with those products\\nDelete your entire Google Account\\nDelete your information\\nRETAINING YOUR INFORMATION\\nWe retain the data we collect for different periods of time depending on what it is, how we use it, and how you configure your settings:\\nSome data you can delete whenever you like, such as your personal info or the content you create or upload, like photos and documents. You can also delete activity information saved in your account, or choose to have it deleted automatically after a set period of time.

We also comply with certain legal frameworks relating to the transfer of data.\\nWhen we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly.\\nU.S. state law requirements\\nSome U.S. state privacy laws require specific disclosures.\\nThis Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how Google handles your information:\\nWe explain the categories of information Google collects and the sources of that information in Information Google collects.\\nWe explain the purposes for which Google collects and uses information in Why Google collects data.\\nWe explain when Google may disclose information in Sharing your information. Google does not sell your personal information. Google also does not \\u201cshare\\u201d your personal information as that term is defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).\\nWe explain how Google retains information in Retaining your information. You can also learn more about how Google anonymizes data. As described there, when Google anonymizes data to protect your privacy, we maintain policies and technical measures to avoid re-identifying that information.\\nU.S. state privacy laws also provide the right to request information about how Google collects, uses, and discloses your information. And they give you the right to access your information, sometimes in a portable format; correct your information; and to request that Google delete that information. Many of these laws also provide the right to opt out of certain forms of profiling and targeted advertising. They also provide the right to not be discriminated against for exercising these privacy rights. Additionally, the CCPA treats certain kinds of information, like health data, as sensitive; when users provide this information, Google only uses it for purposes permitted by the CCPA, like to provide services that are requested and expected by our users.\\nThe Washington My Health My Data Act and Nevada Senate Bill 370 provide specific rights in addition to those rights above, that apply to health information. When you provide this information, Google only processes it with your consent and allows you to withdraw your consent.\\nWe describe the choices you have to manage your privacy and data across Google\\u2019s services in Your privacy controls. These tools allow you to access, review, update and delete your information, as well as export and download a copy of it. You can also control what information we use to show you ads, or turn off personalized ads, by visiting My Ad Center.\\nWhen you use these tools, we\\u2019ll validate your request by verifying that you\\u2019re signed in to your Google Account. If you have questions or requests related to your rights under U.S. state privacy laws, you (or your authorized agent) can also contact Google. And if you disagree with the decision on your request, you can ask Google to reconsider it by responding to our email.\\nWe also provide more information on Google\\u2019s handling of CCPA requests.\\nSome U.S. state privacy laws also require a description of data practices using specific categories. This table uses these categories to organize the information in this Privacy Policy.\\nCategories of information we collect\\nIdentifiers and similar information such as your name and password, phone number, and address, as well as unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you\\u2019re using.

We understand this is a big responsibility and work hard to protect your information and put you in control.\\nThis Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information.\\nPrivacy Checkup\\nLooking to change your privacy settings?\\nTake the Privacy Checkup\\nEffective September 16, 2024 | Archived versions | Download PDF\\nContents\\nIntroduction\\nInformation Google collects\\nWhy Google collects data\\nYour privacy controls\\nSharing your information\\nKeeping your information secure\\nExporting & deleting your information\\nRetaining your information\\nCompliance & cooperation with regulators\\nAbout this policy\\nRelated privacy practices\\nWe build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:\\nGoogle apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home\\nPlatforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system\\nProducts that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps\\nYou can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you\\u2019re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like Chrome Incognito mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.\\nTo help explain things as clearly as possible, we\\u2019ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for key terms. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us.\\nINFORMATION GOOGLE COLLECTS\\nWe want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services\\nWe collect information to provide better services to all our users \\u2014 from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you\\u2019ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.\\nWhen you\\u2019re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you\\u2019re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.\\nWhen you\\u2019re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information.\\nThings you create or provide to us\\nWhen you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account. Even if you aren\\u2019t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information \\u2014 like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.\\nWe also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services. This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.\\nInformation we collect as you use our services\\nYour apps, browsers & devices\\nWe collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.\\nThe information we collect includes unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request.\\nWe collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers \\u2014 for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you\\u2019re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your device type and carrier name, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings, other information about how you\\u2019re using your Android device.\\nYour activity\\nWe collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:\\nTerms you search for\\nVideos you watch\\nViews and interactions with content and ads\\nVoice and audio information\\nPurchase activity\\nPeople with whom you communicate or share content\\nActivity on third-party sites and apps that use our services\\nChrome browsing history you\\u2019ve synced with your Google Account\\nIf you use our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.\\nYou can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that\\u2019s saved in your account.\\nGo to Google Account\\nYour location information\\nWe collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.\\nDepending on the products you\\u2019re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:\\nGPS and other sensor data from your device\\nIP address\\nActivity on Google services, such as from your searches or places you label like home or work\\nInformation about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices\\nThe types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device\\u2019s location on or off using the device\\u2019s settings app. You can also turn on Location History if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about how we use location information.\\nIn some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google\\u2019s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google\\u2019s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse. We also receive information from partners to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.\\nWe use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases, and server logs.\\nWHY GOOGLE COLLECTS DATA\\nWe use data to build better services\\nWe use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:\\nProvide our services\\nWe use your information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.\\nMaintain & improve our services\\nWe also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services \\u2014 for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.\\nDevelop new services\\nWe use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google\\u2019s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.\\nProvide personalized services, including content and ads\\nWe use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results. For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you\\u2019ve already installed and videos you\\u2019ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.\\nDepending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for \\u201cmountain bikes,\\u201d you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in My Ad Center.\\nWe don\\u2019t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.\\nWe don\\u2019t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.\\nWe don\\u2019t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the \\u201ctap to call\\u201d button, we\\u2019ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.\\nGo to My Ad Center\\nMeasure performance\\nWe use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to link information about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.\\nCommunicate with you\\nWe use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we\\u2019ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.\\nProtect Google, our users, and the public\\nWe use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.\\nWe use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.\\nWe may use the information we collect across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google\\u2019s services and the ads delivered by Google.\\nIf other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.\\nWe\\u2019ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn\\u2019t covered in this Privacy Policy.\\nYOUR PRIVACY CONTROLS\\nYou have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used\\nThis section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the Privacy Checkup, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products \\u2014 you can learn more in our Product Privacy Guide.\\nGo to Privacy Checkup\\nManaging, reviewing, and updating your information\\nWhen you\\u2019re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you\\u2019ve saved with Google.\\nWe also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your Google Account includes:\\nPrivacy controls\\nActivity Controls\\nDecide what types of activity you\\u2019d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.\\nGo to Activity Controls\\nAd settings\\nManage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.

For example, you can modify location settings on your Android device.\\nSHARING YOUR INFORMATION\\nWhen you share your information\\nMany of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.\\nWhen you\\u2019re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting.\\nWhen Google shares your information\\nWe do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:\\nWith your consent\\nWe\\u2019ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you use Google Home to make a reservation through a booking service, we\\u2019ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to review and manage third party apps and sites you have given access to data in your Google Account. We\\u2019ll ask for your explicit consent to share any sensitive personal information.\\nWith domain administrators\\nIf you\\u2019re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your domain administrator and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account.

For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google\\u2019s audio recognition technologies.\\nFor legal reasons\\nWe will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:\\nRespond to any applicable law, regulation,legal process, or enforceable governmental request. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our Transparency Report.\\nEnforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.\\nDetect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.\\nProtect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users, or the public.\\nWe may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners \\u2014 like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services. We also allow specific partners to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.\\nIf Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we\\u2019ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.\\nKEEPING YOUR INFORMATION SECURE\\nWe build security into our services to protect your information\\nAll Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information.

Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.\\nEXPORTING & DELETING YOUR INFORMATION\\nYou can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time\\nYou can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.\\nExport your data\\nTo delete your information, you can:\\nDelete your content from specific Google services\\nSearch for and then delete specific items from your account using My Activity\\nDelete specific Google products, including your information associated with those products\\nDelete your entire Google Account\\nDelete your information\\nRETAINING YOUR INFORMATION\\nWe retain the data we collect for different periods of time depending on what it is, how we use it, and how you configure your settings:\\nSome data you can delete whenever you like, such as your personal info or the content you create or upload, like photos and documents. You can also delete activity information saved in your account, or choose to have it deleted automatically after a set period of time.

We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.\\nYou can read more about Google\\u2019s data retention periods, including how long it takes us to delete your information.\\nCOMPLIANCE & COOPERATION WITH REGULATORS\\nWe regularly review this Privacy Policy and make sure that we process your information in ways that comply with it.\\nData transfers\\nWe maintain servers around the world and your information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live. Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others. Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy. We also comply with certain legal frameworks relating to the transfer of data.\\nWhen we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly.\\nU.S. state law requirements\\nSome U.S. state privacy laws require specific disclosures.\\nThis Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how Google handles your information:\\nWe explain the categories of information Google collects and the sources of that information in Information Google collects.\\nWe explain the purposes for which Google collects and uses information in Why Google collects data.\\nWe explain when Google may disclose information in Sharing your information. Google does not sell your personal information. Google also does not \\u201cshare\\u201d your personal information as that term is defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).\\nWe explain how Google retains information in Retaining your information. You can also learn more about how Google anonymizes data. As described there, when Google anonymizes data to protect your privacy, we maintain policies and technical measures to avoid re-identifying that information.\\nU.S. state privacy laws also provide the right to request information about how Google collects, uses, and discloses your information. And they give you the right to access your information, sometimes in a portable format; correct your information; and to request that Google delete that information. Many of these laws also provide the right to opt out of certain forms of profiling and targeted advertising. They also provide the right to not be discriminated against for exercising these privacy rights. Additionally, the CCPA treats certain kinds of information, like health data, as sensitive; when users provide this information, Google only uses it for purposes permitted by the CCPA, like to provide services that are requested and expected by our users.\\nThe Washington My Health My Data Act and Nevada Senate Bill 370 provide specific rights in addition to those rights above, that apply to health information. When you provide this information, Google only processes it with your consent and allows you to withdraw your consent.\\nWe describe the choices you have to manage your privacy and data across Google\\u2019s services in Your privacy controls. These tools allow you to access, review, update and delete your information, as well as export and download a copy of it. You can also control what information we use to show you ads, or turn off personalized ads, by visiting My Ad Center.\\nWhen you use these tools, we\\u2019ll validate your request by verifying that you\\u2019re signed in to your Google Account. If you have questions or requests related to your rights under U.S. state privacy laws, you (or your authorized agent) can also contact Google. And if you disagree with the decision on your request, you can ask Google to reconsider it by responding to our email.\\nWe also provide more information on Google\\u2019s handling of CCPA requests.\\nSome U.S. state privacy laws also require a description of data practices using specific categories. This table uses these categories to organize the information in this Privacy Policy.\\nCategories of information we collect\\nIdentifiers and similar information such as your name and password, phone number, and address, as well as unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you\\u2019re using. Some Google services like YouTube Studio provide the option to submit a valid ID (such as a passport or driver\\u2019s license) to verify your identity to use additional features.\\nDemographic information, such as your age, gender and language.

We understand this is a big responsibility and work hard to protect your information and put you in control.\\nThis Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information.\\nPrivacy Checkup\\nLooking to change your privacy settings?\\nTake the Privacy Checkup\\nEffective September 16, 2024 | Archived versions | Download PDF\\nContents\\nIntroduction\\nInformation Google collects\\nWhy Google collects data\\nYour privacy controls\\nSharing your information\\nKeeping your information secure\\nExporting & deleting your information\\nRetaining your information\\nCompliance & cooperation with regulators\\nAbout this policy\\nRelated privacy practices\\nWe build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:\\nGoogle apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home\\nPlatforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system\\nProducts that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps\\nYou can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you\\u2019re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like Chrome Incognito mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.\\nTo help explain things as clearly as possible, we\\u2019ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for key terms. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us.\\nINFORMATION GOOGLE COLLECTS\\nWe want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services\\nWe collect information to provide better services to all our users \\u2014 from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you\\u2019ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.\\nWhen you\\u2019re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you\\u2019re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.\\nWhen you\\u2019re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information.\\nThings you create or provide to us\\nWhen you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account. Even if you aren\\u2019t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information \\u2014 like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.\\nWe also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services. This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.\\nInformation we collect as you use our services\\nYour apps, browsers & devices\\nWe collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.\\nThe information we collect includes unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request.\\nWe collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers \\u2014 for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you\\u2019re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your device type and carrier name, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings, other information about how you\\u2019re using your Android device.\\nYour activity\\nWe collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:\\nTerms you search for\\nVideos you watch\\nViews and interactions with content and ads\\nVoice and audio information\\nPurchase activity\\nPeople with whom you communicate or share content\\nActivity on third-party sites and apps that use our services\\nChrome browsing history you\\u2019ve synced with your Google Account\\nIf you use our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.\\nYou can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that\\u2019s saved in your account.\\nGo to Google Account\\nYour location information\\nWe collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.\\nDepending on the products you\\u2019re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:\\nGPS and other sensor data from your device\\nIP address\\nActivity on Google services, such as from your searches or places you label like home or work\\nInformation about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices\\nThe types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device\\u2019s location on or off using the device\\u2019s settings app. You can also turn on Location History if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about how we use location information.\\nIn some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google\\u2019s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google\\u2019s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse. We also receive information from partners to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.\\nWe use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases, and server logs.\\nWHY GOOGLE COLLECTS DATA\\nWe use data to build better services\\nWe use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:\\nProvide our services\\nWe use your information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.\\nMaintain & improve our services\\nWe also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services \\u2014 for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.\\nDevelop new services\\nWe use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google\\u2019s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.\\nProvide personalized services, including content and ads\\nWe use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results. For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you\\u2019ve already installed and videos you\\u2019ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.\\nDepending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for \\u201cmountain bikes,\\u201d you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in My Ad Center.\\nWe don\\u2019t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.\\nWe don\\u2019t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.\\nWe don\\u2019t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the \\u201ctap to call\\u201d button, we\\u2019ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.\\nGo to My Ad Center\\nMeasure performance\\nWe use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to link information about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.\\nCommunicate with you\\nWe use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we\\u2019ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.\\nProtect Google, our users, and the public\\nWe use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.\\nWe use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.\\nWe may use the information we collect across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google\\u2019s services and the ads delivered by Google.\\nIf other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.\\nWe\\u2019ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn\\u2019t covered in this Privacy Policy.\\nYOUR PRIVACY CONTROLS\\nYou have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used\\nThis section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the Privacy Checkup, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products \\u2014 you can learn more in our Product Privacy Guide.\\nGo to Privacy Checkup\\nManaging, reviewing, and updating your information\\nWhen you\\u2019re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you\\u2019ve saved with Google.\\nWe also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your Google Account includes:\\nPrivacy controls\\nActivity Controls\\nDecide what types of activity you\\u2019d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations.

Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.\\nWhen you\\u2019re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity.

We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google\\u2019s audio recognition technologies.\\nFor legal reasons\\nWe will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:\\nRespond to any applicable law, regulation,legal process, or enforceable governmental request.

You can also learn more about how Google anonymizes data. As described there, when Google anonymizes data to protect your privacy, we maintain policies and technical measures to avoid re-identifying that information.\\nU.S. state privacy laws also provide the right to request information about how Google collects, uses, and discloses your information. And they give you the right to access your information, sometimes in a portable format; correct your information; and to request that Google delete that information. Many of these laws also provide the right to opt out of certain forms of profiling and targeted advertising. They also provide the right to not be discriminated against for exercising these privacy rights. Additionally, the CCPA treats certain kinds of information, like health data, as sensitive; when users provide this information, Google only uses it for purposes permitted by the CCPA, like to provide services that are requested and expected by our users.\\nThe Washington My Health My Data Act and Nevada Senate Bill 370 provide specific rights in addition to those rights above, that apply to health information. When you provide this information, Google only processes it with your consent and allows you to withdraw your consent.\\nWe describe the choices you have to manage your privacy and data across Google\\u2019s services in Your privacy controls. These tools allow you to access, review, update and delete your information, as well as export and download a copy of it. You can also control what information we use to show you ads, or turn off personalized ads, by visiting My Ad Center.\\nWhen you use these tools, we\\u2019ll validate your request by verifying that you\\u2019re signed in to your Google Account. If you have questions or requests related to your rights under U.S. state privacy laws, you (or your authorized agent) can also contact Google. And if you disagree with the decision on your request, you can ask Google to reconsider it by responding to our email.\\nWe also provide more information on Google\\u2019s handling of CCPA requests.\\nSome U.S. state privacy laws also require a description of data practices using specific categories.

We understand this is a big responsibility and work hard to protect your information and put you in control.\\nThis Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information.\\nPrivacy Checkup\\nLooking to change your privacy settings?\\nTake the Privacy Checkup\\nEffective September 16, 2024 | Archived versions | Download PDF\\nContents\\nIntroduction\\nInformation Google collects\\nWhy Google collects data\\nYour privacy controls\\nSharing your information\\nKeeping your information secure\\nExporting & deleting your information\\nRetaining your information\\nCompliance & cooperation with regulators\\nAbout this policy\\nRelated privacy practices\\nWe build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:\\nGoogle apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home\\nPlatforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system\\nProducts that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps\\nYou can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you\\u2019re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like Chrome Incognito mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.\\nTo help explain things as clearly as possible, we\\u2019ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for key terms. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us.\\nINFORMATION GOOGLE COLLECTS\\nWe want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services\\nWe collect information to provide better services to all our users \\u2014 from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you\\u2019ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.\\nWhen you\\u2019re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you\\u2019re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.\\nWhen you\\u2019re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information.\\nThings you create or provide to us\\nWhen you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account. Even if you aren\\u2019t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information \\u2014 like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.\\nWe also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services. This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.\\nInformation we collect as you use our services\\nYour apps, browsers & devices\\nWe collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.\\nThe information we collect includes unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request.\\nWe collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers \\u2014 for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you\\u2019re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your device type and carrier name, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings, other information about how you\\u2019re using your Android device.\\nYour activity\\nWe collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:\\nTerms you search for\\nVideos you watch\\nViews and interactions with content and ads\\nVoice and audio information\\nPurchase activity\\nPeople with whom you communicate or share content\\nActivity on third-party sites and apps that use our services\\nChrome browsing history you\\u2019ve synced with your Google Account\\nIf you use our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.\\nYou can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that\\u2019s saved in your account.\\nGo to Google Account\\nYour location information\\nWe collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.\\nDepending on the products you\\u2019re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:\\nGPS and other sensor data from your device\\nIP address\\nActivity on Google services, such as from your searches or places you label like home or work\\nInformation about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices\\nThe types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device\\u2019s location on or off using the device\\u2019s settings app. You can also turn on Location History if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about how we use location information.\\nIn some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google\\u2019s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google\\u2019s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse. We also receive information from partners to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.\\nWe use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases, and server logs.\\nWHY GOOGLE COLLECTS DATA\\nWe use data to build better services\\nWe use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:\\nProvide our services\\nWe use your information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.\\nMaintain & improve our services\\nWe also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services \\u2014 for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.\\nDevelop new services\\nWe use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google\\u2019s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.\\nProvide personalized services, including content and ads\\nWe use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results. For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you\\u2019ve already installed and videos you\\u2019ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.\\nDepending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for \\u201cmountain bikes,\\u201d you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in My Ad Center.\\nWe don\\u2019t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.\\nWe don\\u2019t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.\\nWe don\\u2019t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the \\u201ctap to call\\u201d button, we\\u2019ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.\\nGo to My Ad Center\\nMeasure performance\\nWe use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to link information about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.\\nCommunicate with you\\nWe use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we\\u2019ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.\\nProtect Google, our users, and the public\\nWe use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.\\nWe use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.\\nWe may use the information we collect across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google\\u2019s services and the ads delivered by Google.\\nIf other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.\\nWe\\u2019ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn\\u2019t covered in this Privacy Policy.\\nYOUR PRIVACY CONTROLS\\nYou have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used\\nThis section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the Privacy Checkup, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products \\u2014 you can learn more in our Product Privacy Guide.\\nGo to Privacy Checkup\\nManaging, reviewing, and updating your information\\nWhen you\\u2019re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you\\u2019ve saved with Google.\\nWe also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your Google Account includes:\\nPrivacy controls\\nActivity Controls\\nDecide what types of activity you\\u2019d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.\\nGo to Activity Controls\\nAd settings\\nManage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.

You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services rely on cookies to function properly, for things like remembering your language preferences.\\nDevice-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can modify location settings on your Android device.\\nSHARING YOUR INFORMATION\\nWhen you share your information\\nMany of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.\\nWhen you\\u2019re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting.\\nWhen Google shares your information\\nWe do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:\\nWith your consent\\nWe\\u2019ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you use Google Home to make a reservation through a booking service, we\\u2019ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to review and manage third party apps and sites you have given access to data in your Google Account. We\\u2019ll ask for your explicit consent to share any sensitive personal information.\\nWith domain administrators\\nIf you\\u2019re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your domain administrator and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account.

For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google\\u2019s audio recognition technologies.\\nFor legal reasons\\nWe will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:\\nRespond to any applicable law, regulation,legal process, or enforceable governmental request. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our Transparency Report.\\nEnforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.\\nDetect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.\\nProtect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users, or the public.\\nWe may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners \\u2014 like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services. We also allow specific partners to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.\\nIf Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we\\u2019ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.\\nKEEPING YOUR INFORMATION SECURE\\nWe build security into our services to protect your information\\nAll Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you.

Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.\\nEXPORTING & DELETING YOUR INFORMATION\\nYou can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time\\nYou can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.\\nExport your data\\nTo delete your information, you can:\\nDelete your content from specific Google services\\nSearch for and then delete specific items from your account using My Activity\\nDelete specific Google products, including your information associated with those products\\nDelete your entire Google Account\\nDelete your information\\nRETAINING YOUR INFORMATION\\nWe retain the data we collect for different periods of time depending on what it is, how we use it, and how you configure your settings:\\nSome data you can delete whenever you like, such as your personal info or the content you create or upload, like photos and documents. You can also delete activity information saved in your account, or choose to have it deleted automatically after a set period of time. We\\u2019ll keep this data in your Google Account until you remove it or choose to have it removed.\\nOther data is deleted or anonymized automatically after a set period of time, such as advertising data in server logs.\\nWe keep some data until you delete your Google Account, such as information about how often you use our services.\\nAnd some data we retain for longer periods of time when necessary for legitimate business or legal purposes, such as security, fraud and abuse prevention, or financial record-keeping.\\nWhen you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form. We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.\\nYou can read more about Google\\u2019s data retention periods, including how long it takes us to delete your information.\\nCOMPLIANCE & COOPERATION WITH REGULATORS\\nWe regularly review this Privacy Policy and make sure that we process your information in ways that comply with it.\\nData transfers\\nWe maintain servers around the world and your information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live. Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others. Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy. We also comply with certain legal frameworks relating to the transfer of data.\\nWhen we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly.\\nU.S. state law requirements\\nSome U.S. state privacy laws require specific disclosures.\\nThis Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how Google handles your information:\\nWe explain the categories of information Google collects and the sources of that information in Information Google collects.\\nWe explain the purposes for which Google collects and uses information in Why Google collects data.\\nWe explain when Google may disclose information in Sharing your information. Google does not sell your personal information. Google also does not \\u201cshare\\u201d your personal information as that term is defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).\\nWe explain how Google retains information in Retaining your information. You can also learn more about how Google anonymizes data. As described there, when Google anonymizes data to protect your privacy, we maintain policies and technical measures to avoid re-identifying that information.\\nU.S. state privacy laws also provide the right to request information about how Google collects, uses, and discloses your information. And they give you the right to access your information, sometimes in a portable format; correct your information; and to request that Google delete that information. Many of these laws also provide the right to opt out of certain forms of profiling and targeted advertising. They also provide the right to not be discriminated against for exercising these privacy rights. Additionally, the CCPA treats certain kinds of information, like health data, as sensitive; when users provide this information, Google only uses it for purposes permitted by the CCPA, like to provide services that are requested and expected by our users.\\nThe Washington My Health My Data Act and Nevada Senate Bill 370 provide specific rights in addition to those rights above, that apply to health information. When you provide this information, Google only processes it with your consent and allows you to withdraw your consent.\\nWe describe the choices you have to manage your privacy and data across Google\\u2019s services in Your privacy controls. These tools allow you to access, review, update and delete your information, as well as export and download a copy of it. You can also control what information we use to show you ads, or turn off personalized ads, by visiting My Ad Center.\\nWhen you use these tools, we\\u2019ll validate your request by verifying that you\\u2019re signed in to your Google Account. If you have questions or requests related to your rights under U.S. state privacy laws, you (or your authorized agent) can also contact Google. And if you disagree with the decision on your request, you can ask Google to reconsider it by responding to our email.\\nWe also provide more information on Google\\u2019s handling of CCPA requests.\\nSome U.S. state privacy laws also require a description of data practices using specific categories. This table uses these categories to organize the information in this Privacy Policy.\\nCategories of information we collect\\nIdentifiers and similar information such as your name and password, phone number, and address, as well as unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you\\u2019re using. Some Google services like YouTube Studio provide the option to submit a valid ID (such as a passport or driver\\u2019s license) to verify your identity to use additional features.\\nDemographic information, such as your age, gender and language. If you choose to use optional features like YouTube Creator Demographics, you can also provide additional information, like your gender identity or race and ethnicity.\\nCommercial information such as your payment information and a history of purchases you make on Google\\u2019s services.\\nBiometric information if you choose to provide it, such as fingerprints in Google\\u2019s product development studies.\\nInternet, network, and other activity information such as your search terms; views and interactions with content and ads; Chrome browsing history you\\u2019ve synced with your Google Account; information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services (like IP address, crash reports, and system activity); and activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services.

Our services include:\\nGoogle apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home\\nPlatforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system\\nProducts that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps\\nYou can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you\\u2019re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like Chrome Incognito mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.\\nTo help explain things as clearly as possible, we\\u2019ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for key terms. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us.\\nINFORMATION GOOGLE COLLECTS\\nWe want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services\\nWe collect information to provide better services to all our users \\u2014 from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you\\u2019ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.\\nWhen you\\u2019re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you\\u2019re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.\\nWhen you\\u2019re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information.\\nThings you create or provide to us\\nWhen you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account. Even if you aren\\u2019t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information \\u2014 like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.\\nWe also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services. This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.\\nInformation we collect as you use our services\\nYour apps, browsers & devices\\nWe collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.\\nThe information we collect includes unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request.\\nWe collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers \\u2014 for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you\\u2019re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your device type and carrier name, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings, other information about how you\\u2019re using your Android device.\\nYour activity\\nWe collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:\\nTerms you search for\\nVideos you watch\\nViews and interactions with content and ads\\nVoice and audio information\\nPurchase activity\\nPeople with whom you communicate or share content\\nActivity on third-party sites and apps that use our services\\nChrome browsing history you\\u2019ve synced with your Google Account\\nIf you use our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.\\nYou can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that\\u2019s saved in your account.\\nGo to Google Account\\nYour location information\\nWe collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.\\nDepending on the products you\\u2019re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:\\nGPS and other sensor data from your device\\nIP address\\nActivity on Google services, such as from your searches or places you label like home or work\\nInformation about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices\\nThe types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device\\u2019s location on or off using the device\\u2019s settings app. You can also turn on Location History if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about how we use location information.\\nIn some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google\\u2019s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google\\u2019s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse. We also receive information from partners to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.\\nWe use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases, and server logs.\\nWHY GOOGLE COLLECTS DATA\\nWe use data to build better services\\nWe use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:\\nProvide our services\\nWe use your information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.\\nMaintain & improve our services\\nWe also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services \\u2014 for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.\\nDevelop new services\\nWe use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google\\u2019s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.\\nProvide personalized services, including content and ads\\nWe use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results. For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you\\u2019ve already installed and videos you\\u2019ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.\\nDepending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for \\u201cmountain bikes,\\u201d you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in My Ad Center.\\nWe don\\u2019t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.\\nWe don\\u2019t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.\\nWe don\\u2019t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the \\u201ctap to call\\u201d button, we\\u2019ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.\\nGo to My Ad Center\\nMeasure performance\\nWe use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to link information about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.\\nCommunicate with you\\nWe use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we\\u2019ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.\\nProtect Google, our users, and the public\\nWe use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.\\nWe use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.\\nWe may use the information we collect across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google\\u2019s services and the ads delivered by Google.\\nIf other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.\\nWe\\u2019ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn\\u2019t covered in this Privacy Policy.\\nYOUR PRIVACY CONTROLS\\nYou have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used\\nThis section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the Privacy Checkup, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products \\u2014 you can learn more in our Product Privacy Guide.\\nGo to Privacy Checkup\\nManaging, reviewing, and updating your information\\nWhen you\\u2019re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use.

Your Google Account includes:\\nPrivacy controls\\nActivity Controls\\nDecide what types of activity you\\u2019d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.\\nGo to Activity Controls\\nAd settings\\nManage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.

For example, you can modify location settings on your Android device.\\nSHARING YOUR INFORMATION\\nWhen you share your information\\nMany of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.\\nWhen you\\u2019re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity.

For example, if you use Google Home to make a reservation through a booking service, we\\u2019ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to review and manage third party apps and sites you have given access to data in your Google Account. We\\u2019ll ask for your explicit consent to share any sensitive personal information.\\nWith domain administrators\\nIf you\\u2019re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your domain administrator and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account.

We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google\\u2019s audio recognition technologies.\\nFor legal reasons\\nWe will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:\\nRespond to any applicable law, regulation,legal process, or enforceable governmental request.

We also allow specific partners to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.\\nIf Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we\\u2019ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.\\nKEEPING YOUR INFORMATION SECURE\\nWe build security into our services to protect your information\\nAll Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information.

Google does not sell your personal information. Google also does not \\u201cshare\\u201d your personal information as that term is defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).\\nWe explain how Google retains information in Retaining your information. You can also learn more about how Google anonymizes data. As described there, when Google anonymizes data to protect your privacy, we maintain policies and technical measures to avoid re-identifying that information.\\nU.S. state privacy laws also provide the right to request information about how Google collects, uses, and discloses your information. And they give you the right to access your information, sometimes in a portable format; correct your information; and to request that Google delete that information. Many of these laws also provide the right to opt out of certain forms of profiling and targeted advertising. They also provide the right to not be discriminated against for exercising these privacy rights. Additionally, the CCPA treats certain kinds of information, like health data, as sensitive; when users provide this information, Google only uses it for purposes permitted by the CCPA, like to provide services that are requested and expected by our users.\\nThe Washington My Health My Data Act and Nevada Senate Bill 370 provide specific rights in addition to those rights above, that apply to health information. When you provide this information, Google only processes it with your consent and allows you to withdraw your consent.\\nWe describe the choices you have to manage your privacy and data across Google\\u2019s services in Your privacy controls. These tools allow you to access, review, update and delete your information, as well as export and download a copy of it. You can also control what information we use to show you ads, or turn off personalized ads, by visiting My Ad Center.\\nWhen you use these tools, we\\u2019ll validate your request by verifying that you\\u2019re signed in to your Google Account. If you have questions or requests related to your rights under U.S. state privacy laws, you (or your authorized agent) can also contact Google. And if you disagree with the decision on your request, you can ask Google to reconsider it by responding to our email.\\nWe also provide more information on Google\\u2019s handling of CCPA requests.\\nSome U.S. state privacy laws also require a description of data practices using specific categories. This table uses these categories to organize the information in this Privacy Policy.\\nCategories of information we collect\\nIdentifiers and similar information such as your name and password, phone number, and address, as well as unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you\\u2019re using.

Our services include:\\nGoogle apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home\\nPlatforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system\\nProducts that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps\\nYou can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you\\u2019re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like Chrome Incognito mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.\\nTo help explain things as clearly as possible, we\\u2019ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for key terms. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us.\\nINFORMATION GOOGLE COLLECTS\\nWe want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services\\nWe collect information to provide better services to all our users \\u2014 from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you\\u2019ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.\\nWhen you\\u2019re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you\\u2019re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.\\nWhen you\\u2019re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information.\\nThings you create or provide to us\\nWhen you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account. Even if you aren\\u2019t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information \\u2014 like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.\\nWe also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services. This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.\\nInformation we collect as you use our services\\nYour apps, browsers & devices\\nWe collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.\\nThe information we collect includes unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request.\\nWe collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers \\u2014 for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you\\u2019re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your device type and carrier name, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings, other information about how you\\u2019re using your Android device.\\nYour activity\\nWe collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:\\nTerms you search for\\nVideos you watch\\nViews and interactions with content and ads\\nVoice and audio information\\nPurchase activity\\nPeople with whom you communicate or share content\\nActivity on third-party sites and apps that use our services\\nChrome browsing history you\\u2019ve synced with your Google Account\\nIf you use our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.\\nYou can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that\\u2019s saved in your account.\\nGo to Google Account\\nYour location information\\nWe collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.\\nDepending on the products you\\u2019re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:\\nGPS and other sensor data from your device\\nIP address\\nActivity on Google services, such as from your searches or places you label like home or work\\nInformation about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices\\nThe types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device\\u2019s location on or off using the device\\u2019s settings app. You can also turn on Location History if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about how we use location information.\\nIn some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google\\u2019s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google\\u2019s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse. We also receive information from partners to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.\\nWe use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases, and server logs.\\nWHY GOOGLE COLLECTS DATA\\nWe use data to build better services\\nWe use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:\\nProvide our services\\nWe use your information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.\\nMaintain & improve our services\\nWe also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services \\u2014 for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.\\nDevelop new services\\nWe use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google\\u2019s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.\\nProvide personalized services, including content and ads\\nWe use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results. For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you\\u2019ve already installed and videos you\\u2019ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.\\nDepending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for \\u201cmountain bikes,\\u201d you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in My Ad Center.\\nWe don\\u2019t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.\\nWe don\\u2019t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.\\nWe don\\u2019t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the \\u201ctap to call\\u201d button, we\\u2019ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.\\nGo to My Ad Center\\nMeasure performance\\nWe use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to link information about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.\\nCommunicate with you\\nWe use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we\\u2019ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.\\nProtect Google, our users, and the public\\nWe use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.\\nWe use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.\\nWe may use the information we collect across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google\\u2019s services and the ads delivered by Google.\\nIf other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.\\nWe\\u2019ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn\\u2019t covered in this Privacy Policy.\\nYOUR PRIVACY CONTROLS\\nYou have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used\\nThis section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the Privacy Checkup, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products \\u2014 you can learn more in our Product Privacy Guide.\\nGo to Privacy Checkup\\nManaging, reviewing, and updating your information\\nWhen you\\u2019re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use.

And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.\\nGo to Activity Controls\\nAd settings\\nManage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.

For example, you can modify location settings on your Android device.\\nSHARING YOUR INFORMATION\\nWhen you share your information\\nMany of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.\\nWhen you\\u2019re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity.

We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google\\u2019s audio recognition technologies.\\nFor legal reasons\\nWe will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:\\nRespond to any applicable law, regulation,legal process, or enforceable governmental request.

We also allow specific partners to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.\\nIf Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we\\u2019ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.\\nKEEPING YOUR INFORMATION SECURE\\nWe build security into our services to protect your information\\nAll Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information.

Google does not sell your personal information. Google also does not \\u201cshare\\u201d your personal information as that term is defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).\\nWe explain how Google retains information in Retaining your information. You can also learn more about how Google anonymizes data. As described there, when Google anonymizes data to protect your privacy, we maintain policies and technical measures to avoid re-identifying that information.\\nU.S. state privacy laws also provide the right to request information about how Google collects, uses, and discloses your information. And they give you the right to access your information, sometimes in a portable format; correct your information; and to request that Google delete that information. Many of these laws also provide the right to opt out of certain forms of profiling and targeted advertising. They also provide the right to not be discriminated against for exercising these privacy rights. Additionally, the CCPA treats certain kinds of information, like health data, as sensitive; when users provide this information, Google only uses it for purposes permitted by the CCPA, like to provide services that are requested and expected by our users.\\nThe Washington My Health My Data Act and Nevada Senate Bill 370 provide specific rights in addition to those rights above, that apply to health information. When you provide this information, Google only processes it with your consent and allows you to withdraw your consent.\\nWe describe the choices you have to manage your privacy and data across Google\\u2019s services in Your privacy controls. These tools allow you to access, review, update and delete your information, as well as export and download a copy of it. You can also control what information we use to show you ads, or turn off personalized ads, by visiting My Ad Center.\\nWhen you use these tools, we\\u2019ll validate your request by verifying that you\\u2019re signed in to your Google Account. If you have questions or requests related to your rights under U.S. state privacy laws, you (or your authorized agent) can also contact Google. And if you disagree with the decision on your request, you can ask Google to reconsider it by responding to our email.\\nWe also provide more information on Google\\u2019s handling of CCPA requests.\\nSome U.S. state privacy laws also require a description of data practices using specific categories. This table uses these categories to organize the information in this Privacy Policy.\\nCategories of information we collect\\nIdentifiers and similar information such as your name and password, phone number, and address, as well as unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you\\u2019re using.

Our services include:\\nGoogle apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home\\nPlatforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system\\nProducts that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps\\nYou can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like Chrome Incognito mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.\\nTo help explain things as clearly as possible, we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for key terms. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us.\\nINFORMATION GOOGLE COLLECTS\\nWe want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services\\nWe collect information to provide better services to all our users \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094 from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.\\nWhen you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.\\nWhen you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information.\\nThings you create or provide to us\\nWhen you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account. Even if you aren\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094 like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.\\nWe also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services. This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.\\nInformation we collect as you use our services\\nYour apps, browsers & devices\\nWe collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.\\nThe information we collect includes unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request.\\nWe collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094 for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your device type and carrier name, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings, other information about how you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re using your Android device.\\nYour activity\\nWe collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:\\nTerms you search for\\nVideos you watch\\nViews and interactions with content and ads\\nVoice and audio information\\nPurchase activity\\nPeople with whom you communicate or share content\\nActivity on third-party sites and apps that use our services\\nChrome browsing history you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve synced with your Google Account\\nIf you use our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.\\nYou can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s saved in your account.\\nGo to Google Account\\nYour location information\\nWe collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.\\nDepending on the products you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:\\nGPS and other sensor data from your device\\nIP address\\nActivity on Google services, such as from your searches or places you label like home or work\\nInformation about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices\\nThe types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s location on or off using the device\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s settings app. You can also turn on Location History if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about how we use location information.\\nIn some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse. We also receive information from partners to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.\\nWe use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases, and server logs.\\nWHY GOOGLE COLLECTS DATA\\nWe use data to build better services\\nWe use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:\\nProvide our services\\nWe use your information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.\\nMaintain & improve our services\\nWe also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094 for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.\\nDevelop new services\\nWe use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.\\nProvide personalized services, including content and ads\\nWe use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results. For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve already installed and videos you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.\\nDepending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cmountain bikes,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in My Ad Center.\\nWe don\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.\\nWe don\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.\\nWe don\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009ctap to call\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d button, we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.\\nGo to My Ad Center\\nMeasure performance\\nWe use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to link information about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.\\nCommunicate with you\\nWe use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.\\nProtect Google, our users, and the public\\nWe use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.\\nWe use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.\\nWe may use the information we collect across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s services and the ads delivered by Google.\\nIf other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo.

And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations.

For example, you can modify location settings on your Android device.\\nSHARING YOUR INFORMATION\\nWhen you share your information\\nMany of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private.

For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s audio recognition technologies.\\nFor legal reasons\\nWe will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:\\nRespond to any applicable law, regulation,legal process, or enforceable governmental request.

Many of these laws also provide the right to opt out of certain forms of profiling and targeted advertising. They also provide the right to not be discriminated against for exercising these privacy rights.
